# Morrowind Script Extender Nightly (MWSE 2.1)

### Download the latest nightly build [here](https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip)!

The previous stable release is available at the  [Morrowind Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45468), but is now bundled by default with [MGE XE 0.10.1](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102).  
The stable release does **not** include Lua support.

For mod authors, the best way to learn MWSE and get assistance is to ask questions in the #mwse channel of the [Morrowind Modding Community Discord](https://discord.gg/nTF2PZR).

The existing documentation is incomplete and partially outdated, but it can still be a useful resource, over at [mwse.readthedocs.io](https://mwse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
